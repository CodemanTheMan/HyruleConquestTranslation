"ConquestAI is the Overhauled Hyrule Conquest AI.\n"
" It supports most factions to some degree. Currently, The Kingdom of Hyrule, The "
"Gerudo, The Gorons and The Zora Dominion Factions have full support and balancing.\n"
"\n"
" Please report issues on the HC discord or comment on the other media locations (see "
"the links in the main menu).\n"
" on Hard difficulty and below, the AI receives a penalty to responsiveness and overall "
"decision making in all areas, which increases per lower level. \n"
"\n"
" Finally in ConquestAI, the AI behavior (Aggressive, Defensive, Balanced) has no effect."
