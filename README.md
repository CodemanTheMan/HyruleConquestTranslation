# HyruleConquestTranslation
A repository for the Hyrule Conquest translation project.

HOW TO TRANSLATE
- Talk to Codeman so he'll admit you in
- Create a file with your translation code's name (czech = cz, spanish = es, etc.)
- Make a copy of /files/0.12 files/default's files in your language's file
- Add the code of your language to the beginning of the files (hyrule-conquest-civilizations.pot > es.hyrule-conquest-civilizations.pot)
- Write your translations in msgstr.
